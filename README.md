# WellesleyGoose by Bianca Pio and Avery Kim

Overview of the state of the implementation: 
We currently have two seperate apps set up so that we can work on both the HonkHonk and Map screens simultaneously while we are working to figure out screen navigation. 
Wellesley Goose is the repo for the map page.
https://github.com/bpio12/WellesleyGoosePt2 is the repo for the honkhonk page.

Describes what currently works and what does not work
What works: you can add colored coded pins to the map and they are stored in firebase, open camera on honkhonk 
What does not work: screen navigation using contexts to pass function calls, uploading images to firebase database, user authentication

Describes any changes that you have made to your Revised Design
We do not believe we will have the time to be able to implement the voting system on the honkhonk page. Therefore, you will only be able to leave comments on the posts if we 
have time to add that feature. Our goal right now is to be able to add photos and have them be stored in firebase.

Provide an updated version of your Work Plan for the next 9 days (i.e., your plans for completing the final project by Wed Dec 22)
Avery and I will be doing pair progamming on Goose on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week. We are hoping to finish screen navigation first,
then image storage, and then user authentication. If we still have extra time, we will work on adding comments and likes to the honkhonk page.
